# Latest 2sxc Sources

This folder contains the latest builds of the 2sxc sources. 
This means, that all JS projects will copy the dist-results to here.
The 2sxc-server project will also access this folder and copy the contents to DNN etc. 
and use these files for the production build.

## Change 2025-12-23 Excluded from Git

Starting from now we'll exclude this contents from git,
as it doesn't make sense to overwhelm the repo with temporary data.
